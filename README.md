# Supplementary Material to the paper "An Abstract Interpretation for Divergence Analysis on Control Flow Graphs"

The documentation of the Coq code is avalailable [here](http://compilers.cs.uni-saarland.de/projects/uniana/toc.html).

To compile the Coq proofs you need [Coq 8.10.1](https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.10.1).
There are no further dependencies.

Executing
```
$ make
```
compiles the whole development.

The directory ```uniana``` contains the Coq formalization.
