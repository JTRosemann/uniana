# Supplementary Material to the paper "An Abstract Interpretation for Divergence Analysis on Control Flow Graphs"

To compile the Coq proofs you need [Coq 8.10.1](https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.10.1).
There are no further dependencies.

Executing
```
$ make
```
compiles the whole development.

This package contains a pre-compiled coqdoc HTML version of the development that you can inspect in `html/`

This package also contains a copy of the submitted paper that relative links to the coqdoc for all definitions and theorems formalized in Coq.
Unfortunately, the standard Mac Preview app does not open links in PDFs to local files.
They do work with the popular PDF viewer [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/).
